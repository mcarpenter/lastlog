lastlog

lastlog is a small program to display the contents of Solaris'
/var/adm/lastlog. This is a binary file that gets updated upon each
user login.

Although similar information can be extracted from wtmpx(4) (using
last(1)), reading the lastlog may be simpler or quicker if wtmpx(4)
grows quickly or is aggressively rolled.

The lastlog should not be confused with lastlogin(1M) from the
Solaris accounting facility.

Usage:

  lastlog
